      Every Page:

        - Separate pop up window for editing fields and or deletion.
          
          * We will need to use react-router-dom to solve our multiple-window
          issue.

            ^ Specifically, we can use content ids and their data for this type of 
            dynamic route: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route#path
        
        - Editor for a content item

Case Study:

Often times, Ryu is scrolling through the internet whilst tired, travelling, and/or about to do something important. In those moments,
sometimes he sees something that is worth keeping note of, but not acting upon right away. Ryu screenshots the IPhone/Mac screen,
bookmarks the page, and/or makes a note in his IPhone notes app. Eventually, Ryu forgets about these memos and finds them again, completely
confused by what the context was. If he has possibly been reminded of it the next day, he could wrote some context for it and started
something, or perhaps wrote some context and saved it for later date.


  Happy Path: 

    This is where Ryu thought about creating a system that would:
    
      1. Save the screenshot, note, or bookmark.
    
      2. Remind Ryu of screenshots with no context, so that
      he actually understands what they were for in the future.
    
      3. Extract text from screenshots and bookmarked pages to
      allow for search on these memos when he thinks about them
      later on.
    
      4. Do analytics and keep track of what type of content he is saving 
      and suggest some ways to explore his ideas.


Dying Wish:
  
The application is really detailed for each of the three content types and each content type feels completely maxed out.
Then again, the searching makes them feel all the same when searched.
