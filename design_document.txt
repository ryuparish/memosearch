Case Study:

Often times, Ryu is scrolling through the internet whilst tired, travelling, and/or about to do something important. In those moments,
sometimes he sees something that is worth keeping note of, but not acting upon right away. Ryu screenshots the IPhone/Mac screen,
bookmarks the page, and/or makes a note in his IPhone notes app. Eventually, Ryu forgets about these memos and finds them again, completely
confused by what the context was. If he has possibly been reminded of it the next day, he could wrote some context for it and started
something, or perhaps wrote some context and saved it for later date.

This is where Ryu thought about creating a system that would:

  1. Save the screenshot, note, or bookmark.

  2. Remind Ryu of screenshots with no context, so that
  he actually understands what they were for in the future.

  3. Extract text from screenshots and bookmarked pages to
  allow for search on these memos when he thinks about them
  later on.

  4. Do analytics and keep track of what type of content he is saving 
  and suggest some ways to explore his ideas.
