Why can we not use "electron ." from the command line?

  - Electron is unfortunately not a part of the developer tools program for Apple.
  This means that we cannot run electron by itself and we must run it through npm (npm run electron-dev, where
  electron-dev is an alias for electron . within the npm shell)

How is this project setup? What is are the main components that make up this project?

  - This project has three main portions

    * Flask

      ^ For having an ML backend to do ML stuff and other pythonic things

    * Electron

      ^ For having the application be a desktop application rather than a browser application

    * React

      ^ For having react components within the Electron desktop application 

What is the benefit of having React vs. no React?

  - We want to be able to load more than just HTML dynamicallly. We want react components that 
  can make function calls and have more functionality (such as a dynamically generated list)
  than a HTML page.

    * Otherwise, we have to hack our way by modifying jinja in Python and sending HTML through Flask sporadically.

What is public/main.js?

  - This file in the src is for piping everything that the react application on port XXXX sends into the
  electron desktop application.

    * Assert that the link is complete and insert into db.
  - Analyzed

      ^ Use ml (sent bert) to encode the title+text.
    * Send back the title, text, and vector.
  - Retrieved
    * Query database in react and get the link data.
