Why can we not use "electron ." from the command line?

  - Electron is unfortunately not a part of the developer tools program for Apple.
  This means that we cannot run electron by itself and we must run it through npm (npm run electron-dev, where
  electron-dev is an alias for electron . within the npm shell)

How is this project setup? What is are the main components that make up this project?

  - This project has three main portions

    * Flask

      ^ For having an ML backend to do ML stuff and other pythonic things

    * Electron

      ^ For having the application be a desktop application rather than a browser application

    * React

      ^ For having react components within the Electron desktop application
